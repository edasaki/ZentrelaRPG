# ZentrelaRPG
RPG plugin for the Zentrela Minecraft server.

No support provided for any code - the plugin is being released because I have no plans to work on any other Minecraft related things.

Completed features include:
- NPC Shops
- Configuration-based quest system
- Full custom combat (PvP and PvE)
- 7 classes and 50+ custom spells
- "Soaring"; custom flying feature with incomplete support for particles
- Horse/stables system
- Dungeon system
- Buycraft integration
- Votifier integration
- Custom hologram API
- Custom chat manager
- Custom ranks
- Dupe-free trading system
- Polygon (with automated rectangle detection) Region & Danger Level system
- Custom PvP & Mob
- Donor ranks and perks
- Warp system
- Custom command manager
- Parties with EXP sharing
- Automatically generated items/equipment
- Formula-based item and mob balancing
- Fancy /help menu
- Trinket system
- Reward point system
- Integrated toplist
- Badges
- Ban/IPBan/Mute system
- Option manager
- Motd manager
- Menubuilder API
- and a couple other things, probably

Incomplete/Unimplemented features (stuff that's partially coded but never got added to the game):
- World bosses (nearly complete)
- Skills (Woodcutting, etc.)
- Music system
- Instanced dungeons
- Rebirths
- Custom Pets (nearly complete)
- Cheat detection

You will need to get the other repo, ZentrelaCore, as well (two plugins required).

You will need to build ZentrelaCore from source; the SQL stuff is hard-coded.

Not for hire.

It's a bit disorganized as it was a one-man project, but it should be more than clean enough to work with.

Feel free to send pull requests, I'll accept if it's something useful.
